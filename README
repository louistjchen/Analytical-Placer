Please read this file before compiling and launching the analytical placer.

Please follow the steps below to achieve successful compilation.
1)  Use <cd> to switch to the "a2" directory.
2)  Type <make> or <make all> to compile the source code.
    This will generate an executable called "Placer-LouisChen".
    Note that SuiteSparse library is compiled by default. If it complains
    about library issue, you may consider recompiling the library.
3)  Type <make clean> if wish to clean the project.

Please follow the steps below to launch the application successfully.
4)  Use <pwd> to make sure current directory is "a2".
5)  To run the application, type <./Placer-LouisChen "cct-file-path">.
    The test circuit files are under the "a2/testcases" directory.

Please follow the steps below to execute the application successfully.
6)  Press <Proceed> to initialize the program (solve linear system once).
7)  Now you should see 3 buttons got created
    - Press <Rat's Nest ON/OFF> to turn on/off rat's nest.
    - Press <Snap to Grid> to perform fitting.
    - Press <Constraint ON/OFF> to turn on/off placement restriction.
    Always make sure <Constraint ON/OFF> is configured to your wish
    before pressing <Snap to Grid>.
8)  Press <Proceed> to execute 1 spread and solve iteration.
9)  When <Snap to Grid> is pressed, pressing <Proceed> or <Exit> will
    exit the program mercifully.

Hope you had a great time exploring my analytical placer program! :)
